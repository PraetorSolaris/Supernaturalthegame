Campaign Mode:
The campaign mode will introduce the player to the game, in a sense that
they were a person who was rescued by a key character from the Supernatural
series.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Character Customization:
Character creation will determine the story of your character.
In the first season, we plan to have both a female and male
character model as selectable options.

By the time the second season is released, we plan to implement face
customization(meaning a person could take a photo of themselves and use
that picture as their character face. We understand that this may mean we
could have multiple Deans, Sams, Crowleys, etc running around. That is the
players choice.

There will be a limitation on character names imposed which will help
alleviate character names from being created with toxicity. For example,
a person will not be able to create a character name that contains profanity,
racial slurs, sexual references, or other names which are not conducive to a
desirable atmosphere.
